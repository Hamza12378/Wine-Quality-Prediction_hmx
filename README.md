# Wine-Quality-Prediction_hmx

This repository contains a Wine Quality Prediction implemented in a Jupyter Notebook. The notebook aims to predict the quality of wines based on various chemical attributes. It uses a machine learning model to make these predictions.


# Dataset

The dataset used for this project is the Wine Quality Dataset provided in the repository, which consists of several attributes such as fixed acidity,	volatile acidity,	citric acid,	residual sugar,	chlorides,	free sulfur dioxide,	total sulfur dioxide,	density,	pH,	sulphates,	alcohol and others, along with a quality rating for each wine. The dataset has been preprocessed and cleaned for use in the prediction model.

# Methodology

The project follows these key steps:

**1. Data Preprocessing:** Data cleaning, handling missing values, and feature engineering to prepare the dataset for modeling.

**2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Data visualization and statistical analysis to gain insights into the relationships between attributes and wine quality.

**3. Feature Selection:** Identifying the most important features that contribute to wine quality.

**4. Model Selection:** Evaluating and selecting the most suitable machine learning algorithms for the prediction task.

**5. Model Training:** Training the selected machine learning model using the dataset.

**6. Model Evaluation:** Assessing the model's performance with various evaluation metrics such as accuracy, F1-score, and more.
